## MCP Server

Al Elements supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-driven development.

Copy Markdown Open

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows Al assistants like Claude, Cursor, and other Al- powered tools to securely connect with external data sources and systems. Think of it as a "universal remote" that lets your Al tools access real-world data and functionality.

I Elements supports MCP to supercharge your Al development workflow.

## Installation Guide

## Step 1: Choose Your Al Tool

First, make sure you're using an Al development tool that supports MCP:

⚫ Claude Desktop (Free-recommended for beginners)

⚫ Cursor (Al-powered code editor)

• Windsurf by Codeium (Al development platform)

⚫ Other MCP-compatible tools

## Step 2: Locate Your Configuration File

Depending on your Al tool, you'll need to edit one of these files:

⚫ Claude Desktop: .cursor/mcp.json

. Cursor: .cursor/mcp.json

	- Windsurf: .codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json

⚫ Other tools: Check your tool's MCP documentation

## Step 3: Add Al Elements Configuration

Copy and paste this configuration into your MCP config file:

.cursor/mcp.json

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-elements": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "ncp-remote",
        "https://registry.ai-sdk.dev/api/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}

## Step 4: Restart Your Al Tool

Close and reopen your Al application for the changes to take effect.

## Step 5: Verify the Connection

Test the integration by asking your Al assistant:

"What Al Elements components are available for building an Al app?"

If successful, your Al should be able to list and explain Al Elements components!

## Multiple MCP Servers

You can use Al Elements alongside other MCP servers:

[ ] cursor/mcp.json 0

"mcpServers": (
"ai-elements": {
"command": "npx",
"args": [-y", "mcp-remote", "https://registry.ai-sdk.dev/api/mcp"]
).
"github": {
"command": "npx",
"args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
}.
"filesystem": (
"command": "npx"
"args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"]

## Usage Examples

| Ask your Al assistant:                                                             |
| "Show me how to use the Al Elements Promptinput component with different variants" |
| Expected response will include current documentation and code examples.            |
| Building Layouts                                                                   |
| "Help me create an Al app layout using Al Elements components"                     |

Your Al can suggest appropriate layout components and provide implementation code.
